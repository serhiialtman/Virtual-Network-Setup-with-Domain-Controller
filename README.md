## Introduction

In this project, I designed and implemented a virtual network using VirtualBox. I configured two virtual machines, one running Windows Server 2019 and the other Windows 10. The Windows Server 2019 machine was set up as a Domain Controller (DC) hosting Active Directory. The DC was configured with two network adapters: one for internet access and another for a private network. I assigned IP addresses to the internal network using DHCP for automatic IP configuration. Additionally, I automated the creation of 1,000 Active Directory user accounts using a PowerShell script.
